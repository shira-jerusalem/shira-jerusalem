The city is sacred to Judaism, and in contrast, Christianity and Sunni Islam also attribute holiness to it. It was the center of the life of the Jewish people in ancient times, and the object of its longing and longing while in exile.
<br> Because of its religious importance, the city has throughout the ages been the focus of wars and conflicts, which continue to this day.
<br>Since the end of the 19th century, neighborhoods of the new city have developed around the Old City, which, as of the 21st century, house most of its inhabitants.
